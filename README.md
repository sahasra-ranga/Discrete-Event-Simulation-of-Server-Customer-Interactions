# Discrete-Event-Simulation-of-Server-Customer-Interactions
A Java-based discrete event simulation that models customer arrivals, service processes, and waiting queues across multiple servers. The project tracks key metrics like wait times, queue lengths, and server idle periods using an immutable, event-driven architecture with functional programming patterns.
